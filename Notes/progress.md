# 📌 Progress Tracker - Two Sum Problem

## 🗓️ Date: 16 August 2025

### ✅ Solved Problem:

* **Two Sum** (LeetCode #1)

---

### 🧠 Approaches Tried:

1. **Brute Force Approach (Nested Loops)**

   - Code: First solution
   - Time Complexity: O(n²)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Explanation: Har element ke liye doosre element ko check karna until sum == target.

2. **Optimized Approach (Index Difference Trick)**

   - Code: Second solution
   - Time Complexity: O(n²) (but slightly efficient in some cases)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Explanation: i aur j ka relation use kiya, direct `(j, j-i)` indices nikalne ka try.

### 🔍 Key Learnings:

- Brute force samajhna easy hota hai, but large input ke liye slow ho jata hai.
- Index difference trick ek naya perspective deta hai problem solving ka.
- Next step: HashMap use karke **O(n) optimized solution** implement karna.

### 📊 Status:

- [x] Problem understood
- [x] Two different approaches tried
- [ ] HashMap optimized approach pending
